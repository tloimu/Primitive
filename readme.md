# Primitive

This is my study project on Unreal Engine 5. It tries to become an exploration/survival game.

Uses the free Voxel Plugin for terrain creation.

## Building

I have excluded some asset packs to save space (over 10+GB), so you need to add these before building from scratch:
- **European Hornbeam**
- **Procedural Nature Pack**
- **Animation Starter Pack**
- **Low Poly Viking World**
