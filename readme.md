# Primitive

This is my study project on Unreal Engine 5. It tries to become an exploration/survival game.

Uses the free Voxel Plugin for terrain creation.

## Building

I have excluded **European Hornbeam** and **Procedural Nature Pack** from Git as they take over 11GB alone. So, before building you need to add those two free asset packs from Epic's Unreal Engine Marketplace before trying to run or build this project.
